   - Generate password for "Mail"
   - Use this password in `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

## Deployment Options

### ☁️ Cloud Deployment (Recommended - Easiest!)

**No hardware needed!** Deploy to cloud platforms in minutes. Perfect if you don't have a Raspberry Pi or want easier setup.

See [CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT.md](CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions on:
- **Railway** (Recommended - easiest setup, $5/month)
- **Render** (Free tier available, $7/month always-on)
- **Fly.io** (Generous free tier, $5/month)
- **DigitalOcean** ($5-12/month)
- **AWS EC2** (Most control, $3.50-10/month)

**Quick start with Railway:**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect to Railway
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy! (Takes ~5 minutes)

### 🍓 Raspberry Pi Deployment

See [RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md](RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions on:
- Setting up Raspberry Pi OS
- Installing Tailscale for remote access
- Running as a systemd service
- Monitoring and maintenance

## Configuration

Edit `.env` file to customize:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com

# SMTP Settings
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587

# Optional: Custom search terms
CUSTOM_SEARCH_TERMS=navy champion reverse weave,yale champion reverse weave

# Optional: Monitoring frequency (minutes)
MONITORING_FREQUENCY=60

# Optional: Scraping limits
MAX_PAGES_EBAY=3
MAX_PAGES_DEPOP=2

# Optional: Headless mode (true for servers, false for local debugging)
HEADLESS=true
```

## File Structure

```

## How It Works

1. **Scraping**: Bot searches eBay and Depop using web scraping and APIs
2. **Filtering**: Only Champion reverse weave items are included
3. **Deduplication**: SQLite database tracks seen listings to prevent duplicates
4. **Email**: HTML emails sent hourly with new listings and images
5. **Scheduling**: Runs continuously with hourly checks

## Troubleshooting

### Email Issues
- Verify app password (not regular password)
- Check SMTP settings for your provider
- Test with simple Python script first

### No Listings Found
- Check internet connection
- Verify search terms
- Check logs for scraping errors
- Sites may have changed their structure

### Service Issues (Raspberry Pi)
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status champion-monitor.service

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u champion-monitor.service -f

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart champion-monitor.service
```

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

- **Respectful Scraping**: Bot includes delays between requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable limits on pages scraped
- **Terms of Service**: Ensure compliance with eBay and Depop ToS
- **Personal Use**: Designed for personal monitoring only
